Admin Panel – Secondary Marketplace Listings Overview
After the Admin logs into the Admin Dashboard, they should navigate to the Secondary Marketplace module using the Sidebar Navigation.

When the Admin selects the “Secondary Marketplace” module, the system should load the Marketplace Listings Overview page.

On this page, the Admin should see the following metrics displayed at the top of the page:

Total Listings: Shows the total number of property listings currently available in the secondary marketplace.

Active Trades: Shows the count of ongoing active trades for tokenized properties.

Volume Traded (in USD): Displays the total trade volume in US Dollars for all completed trades.

Average Token Price: Displays the average price per token across all listed trades.

Below the metrics, the Admin should see the list of tokenized properties placed for resale, displayed in a table format.

The table should contain the following columns:

Property Name

Token Symbol

Token Contract Address

Listed Tokens Count

Price per Token

Current Status (Active, Sold, Cancelled)

Owner Wallet

Last Traded Date

For each row in the table, there should be the following Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons:

View Trade Logs

Freeze Resale

Remove Listing

Business Logic:

The list should include only tokenized and resale-enabled properties.

The listings should be updated in real-time to reflect the latest marketplace status.

Acceptance Criteria:

The list should be sortable and searchable.

All actions (View Trade Logs, Freeze Resale, Remove Listing) should display a confirmation popup before performing the action.

Validations:

The Token Contract Address should always follow a valid contract address format.

The Price per Token should always be a positive value.

The Admin cannot freeze a listing that is already inactive (Sold or Cancelled).

The page layout should display the metrics section on top, followed by the table of listings below, with filters and pagination controls for easier navigation.

Each action button on the table should include tooltips explaining their functionality for better Admin usability.
