As an admin, I want to manage document types for properties so that I can define required documents for Residential or Commercial listings. From the dashboard, I can access this feature by clicking on the "Property Document Master," which opens the relevant submodule. The list view displays a table containing the following columns: Document Name, Property Type, Mandatory (Yes/No), Accepted File Types, and Actions. Each row in the table includes action icons for editing (pencil icon) and deleting (trash icon) a document type. A prominent "Add New" button appears at the top of the list. 

To help locate specific records, the interface includes filters such as a dropdown to select Property Type (Residential or Commercial) and a text input to search by Document Name. The list is paginated, showing 10 records per page along with navigation controls to move between pages.

When the "Add New" or "Edit" button is clicked, a centered form appears. This form includes fields for Document Name (text input), Property Type (dropdown with options Residential and Commercial), Mandatory (toggle switch for Yes/No), and Accepted File Types (multi-select dropdown with options: pdf, doc, docx, jpg). Below the form are Save and Cancel buttons. Validations ensure that the Document Name is required, limited to 100 characters, and must be alphanumeric with spaces; Property Type must be selected from the dropdown; and at least one Accepted File Type must be selected. Additionally, duplicate document entries are not allowed for the same Property Type.

Acceptance criteria include viewing the document list upon accessing the module, adding a new document with valid inputs and seeing a success message, editing and saving updates with confirmation, and deleting a document upon confirmation with immediate list refresh. If invalid data is entered, an error message appears and the form cannot be submitted.

According to the business rules, only admins with "Master Module" access are allowed to manage document types. Documents marked as Mandatory must be enforced during listing creation based on Property Type, and only the accepted file formats defined in this module should be allowed during property document uploads. This entire functionality is implemented using static data only, with no backend integration, and all validations and behaviors occur at the UI level.
