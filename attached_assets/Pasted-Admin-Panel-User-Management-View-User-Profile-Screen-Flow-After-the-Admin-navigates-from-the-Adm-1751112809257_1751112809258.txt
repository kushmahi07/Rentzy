Admin Panel – User Management: View User Profile
Screen Flow:
After the Admin navigates from the Admin Dashboard → User Management tab, they should see a list of platform users.

User Selection:
When the Admin clicks on a specific user from the user list, the system should open the User Details View for that user.

User Profile Layout:
The User Profile should be displayed in a tabbed view, allowing the Admin to switch between the following tabs based on the user’s role:

Renter Tab

Investor Tab

Both Tabs visible if user has both roles

Data to Display:

Basic Info (Visible in Header or Overview Section):

Full Name

Email Address

Phone Number

KYC Status (e.g., Verified / Pending / Rejected)

Role Information:

Display assigned roles: Renter / Investor / Both

Renter Tab (Visible if user is a Renter):
Booking History:

Acceptance Criteria:
The system should display accurate user data based on the user’s role (Renter, Investor, or Both).

All fields shown must match the data stored in the backend database.

Any section (Renter or Investor) should be hidden if there’s no data available for that user.

If data is missing, display user-friendly fallback messages (e.g., “No bookings found”, “No investments found”).

Validations:
Role Validation:
Before displaying role-specific sections (Renter / Investor), the system must check the user’s assigned roles.

Data Availability Checks:
For each data section, if no relevant data exists, show fallback messages instead of leaving sections blank.
