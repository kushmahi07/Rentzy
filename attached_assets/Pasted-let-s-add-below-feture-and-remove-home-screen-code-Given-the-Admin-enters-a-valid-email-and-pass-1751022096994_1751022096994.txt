let's add below feture and remove home screen code . 
Given the Admin enters a valid email and password, the system should generate a 6-digit OTP and send it to the registered email and mobile number (via SMS). The Admin must enter the OTP within 2 minutes to verify identity. After successful OTP validation, the Admin is redirected to the Dashboard. If credentials or OTP are invalid, the system should provide appropriate error messages. 
Actors

Email/SMS Gateway 
Primary Flow â€“ Successful Login with 2FA 
Admin opens the login page. 
Admin enters email and password. 
System validates the credentials: 
If valid, proceed to OTP verification screen. 
If invalid, show "Invalid email or password". 
System generates a 6-digit OTP, stores it with a timestamp, and sends it via: 
Email 
SMS to registered mobile number 
The OTP screen is shown: 
Input field for 6-digit OTP 
Countdown timer: 2 minutes 
Resend OTP button (initially disabled for 30 seconds) 
Admin enters the OTP and clicks Verify. 
System checks:

Resend OTP Logic: 
Button is enabled only after 30 seconds. 
Allow up to 3 resend attempts. 
After 3 resends, show: "Maximum resend attempts reached. Please login again." 
On resend, a new OTP is generated and timer resets.
