In the **Admin Dashboard**, when the admin navigates to the **Booking Management** section using the sidebar and selects the tab labeled **"Admin Properties Bookings"**, a dedicated interface is presented to manage bookings related specifically to properties added by the admin. This tab is designed to provide a structured, filterable, and interactive view of rental bookings on the platform.

Upon loading, the interface shows a table of bookings with several key details. Each booking entry displays a **Booking ID** (such as "BOOK123", which is clickable and opens a modal with full details), the **Property ID and address** (e.g., "PROP456, 123 Main St, NY"), **Tenant Name** (like "John Doe"), **Start Date** and **End Date** of the booking, the **Status** of the booking indicated by colored tags (Pending in yellow, Confirmed in green, Cancelled in red, Completed in blue), the **Total Price** (formatted with two decimal points, such as "\$500.00"), and the **Dispute Status** (None in gray, Open in orange, Resolved in green). The last column contains action buttons such as **View Details**, **Cancel Booking** (shown only for Pending or Confirmed bookings), and **Open Dispute Chat** (available only if the dispute status is Open).

Above the table, filters are provided to allow the admin to narrow results. These include a **Status dropdown** (with options All, Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled, Completed) and a **Date Range Picker** for selecting a custom range such as "2025-08-01 to 2025-08-31". The admin can also sort bookings by **Start Date** and **Total Price** by clicking on the respective column headers. The list is paginated with 20 bookings per page, and navigation controls such as **Previous**, **Next**, and page numbers are displayed at the bottom of the table. If an error occurs (for example, while loading static data), a red alert box appears with a message like **"Failed to load bookings"**.

Clicking the **"View Details"** button opens a centered modal with a maximum width of 600px. The modal displays full booking details including the Booking ID, Property ID, Address, Tenant Name, Email, and Phone Number. It also shows the Start and End Dates, the Total Price, the Payment Status (Paid, Pending, Refunded), and timestamps for when the booking was created and last updated. If the booking has an open dispute, the modal includes a Dispute section showing the **Dispute Reason** (e.g., "Property not as described") and a **Chat History** with bot and admin responses, each with a timestamp and sender label.

Within this modal, the admin can **Cancel a Booking** if its current status is either Pending or Confirmed. Doing so opens a prompt asking for a **reason (required, max 500 characters)**. If a dispute is open, the admin can also open the **Dispute Chat** interface, which mimics a support-style chat showing preloaded static messages from the bot and admin. All fields are shown in a read-only manner, and actions are conditionally enabled based on booking status.

All interface elements follow **ARIA accessibility standards**, with roles like `grid` for the table and `dialog` for the modal. The UI is also fully responsive and built using **Tailwind CSS**, optimized for desktop and mobile screens.

Validation is handled entirely on the frontend. JWT authentication failures simulate a 403 error state with a visible message. Attempts to cancel non-Pending/Confirmed bookings or open chats on closed disputes simulate 400 errors. Date filter inputs are validated for proper formatting. Cancellation reasons are enforced with a 500-character limit, and any invalid input shows a corresponding alert.

This interface allows the admin to seamlessly browse, review, and manage bookings for platform-owned properties, ensuring all records are accessible, actionable, and clearly represented in a user-friendly frontend layout using only static data for demonstration purposes.
